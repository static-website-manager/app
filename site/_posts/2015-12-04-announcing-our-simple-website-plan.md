title: 'Announcing One Simple Website Plan: One Low-price Plan for Your Website and Blog'
author: Theodore Kimble
excerpt: We’re happy to annouce our simple new <span class="bg-warning">$15/month website plan</span>! We’re replacing our initial tiered pricing model with a single plan that works for all. We hope you enjoy the affordability and predictability that our new pricing plan offers!

## Why the Change?

We initially launched with three pricing plans: Small, Medium and Large, differentiated mostly by the number of team members permitted, but also by a few other criteria. But to me these limits felt forced and arbitrary, and so today we’re adopting a more simple and predictable pricing plan. And best of all, we’ve lowered the price!

## Full Pricing Details

Our new pricing plan is $15 per month per website and is designed to be all that’s needed for you and your team.
