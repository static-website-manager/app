<h1 class="h3">Overview</h1>
<p>Welcome to Static Website Manager! In the most simplistic terms, this application is a static website content management system that relies on Jekyll (a site generator). In reality, it’s much, much more. Static Website Manager will emancipate designers from managing and updating small changes on a website, while empowering non-design team members to write posts, update content, even create new pages without relying on a designer.</p>
<p>The most unique aspect of Static Website Manager is the multi-user interface. What exactly does this mean? Static Website Manager enables teammates to simultaneously make real-time changes to a website while maintaining the integrity and security of the live site. Each user works on their own Staging Branch, can merge their changes with the master Production Branch, and collaborate with coworkers on more complex, long-term changes via their own Custom Branch. Each user is given specific permissions and privacy settings to utilize the best of their design and content creation skill levels—making your web operation as efficient and collaborative as possible.</p>
