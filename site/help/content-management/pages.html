<h1 class="h3">Pages</h1>
<p>Static Website Manager allows any teammate (with “editor” or “designer” permissions) to easily create a new static page for the website they’re working on (e.g., create an About the Author Page or add a Contact Us page, etc.). Pages can be nested and by creating a folder and placing an index.html file in that folder you can achieve clean URLs without filename extensions. <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/pages/">Read more</a> about creating pages in Jekyll.</p>
