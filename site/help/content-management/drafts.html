<h1 class="h3">Drafts</h1>
<p>Drafts are unpublished Posts. The main working difference is that posts don’t automatically need to have a date (still within the Year-Month-Day-Title format required by Jekyll). Once a teammate wants to publish a draft it will be named in the appropriate format and fit into the history of Posts chronologically. <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/drafts/">Read more</a> about working with drafts in Jekyll..</p>
