<p>Static Website Manager utilizes the Jekyll aspect of being “blog aware” to make writing and publishing articles online (i.e., maintaining a blog) extremely easy. Each article—or post—you write is simply stored as a text file under the Posts tab. Each post is automatically named with the format Year-Month-Day-Title. Therefore, when looking at the history of your blog the posts will be listed chronologically. To customize the path name of a post when exporting use Permalinks. <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/pages">Read more</a> about Pages and <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/permalinks/">Permalinks</a> in Jekyll.</p>
