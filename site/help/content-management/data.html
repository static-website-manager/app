<h1 class="h3">Data Files</h1>
<p>Static Website Manager supports three formats of loadable data: CSV, JSON, YAML. The data stored on your site in the Data tab can be used when generating your site, which allows users to avoid repetition in each template. For example, your static website could upload, store, and access a list of members. <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/">Read more</a> about using data files within Jekyll.</p>
