<h1 class="h3">Content Management</h1>
<p>Static Website Manager’s CMS is easy to use while maintaining the full power of custom designs and Liquid tags. The Static Website Manager editor has support for both YAML Front-Matter and HTML/Markdown content. Any changes trigger a website build and your updates can be securely and privately previewed. Plus, built-in support for three roles makes it easy to invite collaborators: writers have access to drafts and posts; editors gain access to pages, collections, data and files; and designers additionally have access to layouts and include files.</p>
