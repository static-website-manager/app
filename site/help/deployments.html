<h1 class="h3">Deployments</h1>
<p>Static Website Manager provides private previews of your compiled website branches through our web-based editor, but deployments let you link a branch to one or more external accounts. Every change made to a linked branch will trigger a new build of that branch’s website to be pushed to the linked account. The only currently supported deployment is Amazon AWS S3.</p>
