<h1 class="h3">Staging Branches</h1>
<p>Each team member will have their own Staging Branch. This is the working branch that each teammate uses to create a new Draft, Post, Page, Form, or make content changes to existing data. Each Staging Branch is linked to a unique user ID, guaranteeing a separate “sandbox” for each member to safely play in (i.e., make changes) that won’t effect the Staging Branch of any other teammate. By default, permissions are set so that teammates do not have access to anyone else’s Staging Branch besides their own; however, this can be adjusted based on team needs.</p>
