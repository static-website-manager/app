<h1 class="h3">Production Branch</h1>
<p>This is the master branch; the branch that rules them all. The Production Branch is assumed to be the same as the final, live website. Typically, only the Admin or lead designer would have access to the Production Branch; however, all privacy settings are variable. Each teammate can Pull Changes from the Production Branch or Publish Changes to the Production Branch, all done with built in safeguards to catch incongruent edits to maintain the integrity of the Production Branch.</p>
