<h1 class="h3">Version Control</h1>
<p>Version control is the summation of commit histories for each team. Because Static Website Manager allows multiple teammates to push changes to a live website by compiling each Staging Branch with the Production Branch, the history of total commits is a critical record that is kept and maintained with the upmost integrity. Version Control allows the Admin, or select teammates, to visualize the multiple branches is use, separate branches, or merge branches based on internal workflows.</p>
<p>The magic of Static Website Manager is in the branches! Static Website Manager allows each teammate to utilize their unique skills on a separate Staging Branch that can be independently deployed. Static websites can now be collaborative, dynamic, and flexible!</p>
