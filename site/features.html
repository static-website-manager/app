      <p><span class="bg-warning">Static Website Manager uses git version control to store your website design files.</span> This means it’s easy to coordinate changes with your team members and rollback in the case of a mistake. You can view your whole project history and see who’s made which changes.</p>
      <p><span class="bg-warning">Each user in your team gets their own staging branch</span>, and you can optionally give team member’s access to the production branch, custom feature branches, or even other staging branches. Now anyone can make and view changes independently of the production website and without fear of breaking it!</p>
      <p>And because <span class="bg-warning">it’s your data, you can pull or clone your repository anytime!</span> We’ll event commit form data back into your repository so <span class="bg-warning">you’re never locked in</span>.</p>
